PARALLEL SEMI-SUPERVISED LDA (pSSLDAx64)
Version 0.1x64

DESCRIPTION

This is a simple fork of David Andrzejewski's very nice
pSSLDA implementation, which is located here:
https://github.com/davidandrzej/pSSLDA

I had a lot of difficulty in getting David's code to compile and execute
in a x64 development environment, so I made some minor tweaks to his code.
This runs nicely now on Windows 10, compiled using MinGW64:
